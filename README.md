Repo for final project


# Project Timeline

1) First we will load the data and combine the two dataframes, while cleaning out states that have many null values and cleaning up the date format. 

2) Secondly, we can do some data exploration with histograms, barcharts, correlation heatmaps, any sort of visual representation of the data. 

3) First I want to try building models out of the original data, but we can then look into performing PCA and finding some similarities across that as well.
