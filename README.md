# ISYE-6740-
Repo for final project

This project was exploring the relationship between housing markets and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). My intention was for the CPI to be equal to "inflation", thereby looking at states that resist or aren't influenced by inflation across the country. 

Final Project for 6740, files are split into 4 categories:
1) Code: Contains code files for analysis, data transformation and analysis
2) Data: Contains raw and cleaned data files
3) KDE Visuals: Contains visuals made from Kernel Density Estimation
4) Visuals: Contains general visualizations created throughout the project
